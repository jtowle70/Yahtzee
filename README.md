Java application that simulates a Yahtzee game

To play this game first run the Yahtzee server class with the
ipaddress of the network you're using the the port number you want
to use. Then run Yahtzee_main to run the user side. Make sure
Yahtzee_main and Yahtzee_server are using the same network ipaddress
and port number. Also be sure to set the number of players in the 
Yahtzee_Server class. When the main is run it will ask for a name from
all players and proceed to open the main GUI.
